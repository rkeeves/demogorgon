I craved to see [sexy senior code](https://youtu.be/sMMpYiiuEMc?t=36) for months now.

I really-really sincerely wished - deep in my dumb little heart - that I could see something beautiful.

I saw [this](https://bitbucket.org/szoti15/dynata-surveys/src/a4b97a91c070e810e2c3ed77ba0918c0b236621e/src/main/java/dynata/surveys/controller/SurveysController.java#lines-46) instead, and [it did kind of hurt](https://youtu.be/G6a1T38ULVg?t=59).

I slept on it, thought about it...

The problem is within me. I am the problem.

I seem to be too attached to a hazy, preconceived, over-romanticized notion of [working with a senior](https://youtu.be/ojQB7PYaU28?t=47).

This is an unrealistic fever dream.
 
P.S.: I think this gaping hole was one of the reasons why I started peeking at what the [funny looking people](https://youtu.be/iSmkqocn0oQ?t=194) were doing.
